I’m a developer and designer with a strong entrepreneurial spirit who build products users love. I lead a front-end team by the day and do side hustle by the night.

In the past, I’ve worked with companies like <strong>Betterware</strong>, <strong>British Gymnastics</strong>, <strong>npower</strong>, <strong>Purplebricks</strong>, agencies and studios like <strong>FishEye</strong> and <strong>The Studio 4</strong>. I’ve been freelancing, working on open-source and side projects since I’ve started my career.

Today, I am helping to build the cyber risk prioritisation platform at <strong><a href="https://www.cyberowl.io/">Cyber Owl</a></strong> as a <strong>Lead Front-End Developer</strong>.

### What
I lead a front-end team by the day and do side hustle by the night.

I’m always keen to expand my engineering and entrepreneurship skills.

### Where
I live in Wolverhampton, United Kingdom with my wife and our son.

I spent the big part of my life in Riga, Latvia, one of my favourite places in the world.

### Weird
When I’m not working, I love to read, run and spend time with my family.

I’m a little obsessed with coffee and pizza.
