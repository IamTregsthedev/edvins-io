Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.

## Notes

- `$` is escaped as `\$`, so you need to use `<!-- prettier-ignore -->` where it's used. Read more about [this](https://github.com/prettier/prettier/issues/6213).
